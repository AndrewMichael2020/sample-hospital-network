# Note: heavy ML/SDV-related packages (sdv, sdmetrics, torch, nvidia-*) are intentionally
# omitted from this runtime requirements file to keep the Docker image small. If you need
# to run synthetic data training or generation inside a container, consider a separate
# image with those dependencies or run them locally in a larger environment.
